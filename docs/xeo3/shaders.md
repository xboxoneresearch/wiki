## XEO3 Shaders
Little is currently known about the XEO3 shader format, for example how the original shaders from Xbox 360 games are converted into the DirectX 11 Durango format. While it is known that that Backwards Compat games' XVCs contain DirectX 11 Durango format shaders in the DLL file format, creation or rendering of these shaders is not currently possible. 

These shaders appear critical to running any graphical xex, as evidenced by attempting to run [XeXMenu on the emulator](https://twitter.com/XB1_HexDecimal/status/1382326180490010630). 

Example: xeo3_3bfc9c1a_932fc286_956f016e_98ef8821_6b9d46d0.dll (From CastleCrashers)
