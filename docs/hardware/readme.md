Upload your PCB pictures to this directory.

Use the following guidelines:
* Create a subdirectory with the name of the soldermask SKU (The one on the front side of the motherboard, in the bottom right corner, starting with X. NOT THE ONE ON THE LABEL)
* Upload at least two pictures: front and back
* Make sure they are high resolution, such that the SKUs are visible when zooming in.
* Update the SKUs page accordingly.
