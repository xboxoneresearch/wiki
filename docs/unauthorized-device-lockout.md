# Unauthorized Xbox Device Lockout & Enforcement

Early research suggests that the lockout of unauthorized Xbox devices is controlled by the above reg key.
On a Retail Series X console, the value is set to "UnauthorizedDeviceFlag : 1" in the PublicInsider10 (Skip Ahead) ring. In theory, deleting the key would disable the lockout system, however this has yet to be tested.

#### Notes
