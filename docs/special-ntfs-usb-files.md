Note: 

* The SystemOS-full.dmpx file is encrypted and requires a retail key
  to decrypt.
* Using *$ConsoleRegion0* & *$ConsoleRegion1* will affect the ability to read Xbox China game discs, but won't affect already installed digital games.
* Non-Chinese Xbox One units cannot be region locked and read Xbox China discs / access China region Xbox Live by *$ConsoleRegion1*.
* $ConsoleRegion0 and $ConsoleRegion1 has been deprecated since OS 10.0.19041.2493 (rs_xbox_release_2005.200512-1756)(insider preview). Devices' region lock status will be remained as the same before it's update to this version. Quitting Insider Preview and re-upgrade the Xbox system while the current latest release ring OS version is equal to or under 10.0.19041.1927 (rs_xbox_release_2004.200415-0000) will re-enable the $ConsoleRegion0 and $ConsoleRegion1.
