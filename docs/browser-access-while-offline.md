# Browser access while offline

## Instructions
- Set up a dns server and set it as default on your xbox one
- Redirect **msftconnecttest.com** to your HTTP server
- Place a blank text file at the root of your HTTP server named **xboxncsi.txt** (This tells the connection test that the file it tried to download was invalid. A valid one would have "Xbox NCSI" in the text file.
)
- Profit?
