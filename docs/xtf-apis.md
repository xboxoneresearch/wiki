# XTF APIs

## What are XTF APIs?
XTF (Also known as Xbox Toolkit Framework) is a set of APIs used in conjunction by the console and XDK or GDK running on a PC. These APIs are generally only active console side on an ERA kit or above, however **patched** methods have allowed UWA kits to use them in the past. They expose a number of functions from console information gathering and application management to controller input simulation, execution, file management and debugging.
